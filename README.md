## What is Monster Hunter Arms?

Monster Hunter Arms is a weapons turorial and interactive flowchart for the video game, Monster Hunter World.

Monster Hunter is a series that has been around since 2004, and since then it has become a cultural staple in Japan. Only with the newly released Monster Hunter World has the series attracted mainstream attention in the west. Monster Hunter World has already become the fastest-selling game in publisher CAPCOM's history, and many new players unfamiliar with the franchise are playing a Monster Hunter Game for the first time.

I made Monster Hunter Arms as a tool to help new players familiarize themselves with the combat mechanics of Monster Hunter World. The site offers summaries of each of the fourteen weapons to help new players compare them, and has in-depth written turorials for more extensive information. Players can even use the combo test to see the moves they can do for a particular weapon.


## Features

### Weapons overview

To help players compare weapons, Monster Hunter Arms summarizes each weapon's playstyle with rankings of the weapon's general attributes, followed by a summary of the weapon's playstyle.

The stats are as follows:

* Power: The damage potential of the weapon's strongest or most used attacks
* Speed: The amount of attacks a weapon is capable of in a given time
* Mobility: How well a weapon is able to move while drawn
* Defense: The weapon's ability to handle oncoming attacks directly
* Support: How well a weapon can synergize with fellow hunters.


### Weapon Tutorials

For more comprehensive information, weapon turtorials explain the mechanics of a weapon, its attacks, and how it should be played.


### Combo Test

To put it simply, a combo is a string of attacks with little to no delay in between. Monster Hunter is an action game where the moves you can do are contextual based on what attack you've just done and what button(s) you press.

The combo test lets you examine a weapon move-by-move, showing you your current attack, a description of that attack, and the different options you can 'combo' into with their button inputs.

Clicking on one of the options will set it as the current attack, and display that attack's options. Alternatively, you can use a Playstation 4 controller to execute the displayed button input of an option to select it.
