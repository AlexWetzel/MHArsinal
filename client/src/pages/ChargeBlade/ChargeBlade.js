			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
				The charge blade is considered one of the most difficult weapons to learn in Monster Hunter,
				not only because it has two forms that synergize with each other, but because it isn't immediately clear how the weapon is meant to be used.
				The charge blade is a versitile weapon with many strengths.
				Sword mode is fairly lightweight and maneuverable, but also has a study shield with strong guard capabilities.
				On the other hand, the axe mode is slow, but is capable of dealing massive damage.
				Effectively using the charge blade means combining the strengths of both modes and minimizing their weaknesses.
				The charge blade is compared to the Swiss army knife for a reason.
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h4>Understanding Phials</h4>
			<p>
				The charge blade has a core mechanic that creates synergy between sword mode and axe mode.
				When you attack in sword mode, you build a charge in your sword. Once you have enough charge, you load that charge, granting you phial energy.
				These phials are units of power that are used for the charge blade's strongest moves.
				Namely, they are used for elemental attacks in axe mode, which unleash powerful phial bursts then these attacks hit the target.
				But just as importantly, phials can be used to charge your shield, boosting your axe attacks further and improving your guarding capabilities.

				There are two phial types among the different charge blade: Power phial, and power element phial.
				Power phial deals damage proportional to the raw physical power of the weapon (not including sharpness or affinity).
				Power phial bursts nor only deal fixed damage, but also exhaust the monster, and will KO with a well placed swing to the head.
				Power element phial bursts deal damage based on the elemental properties of the weapon, and deal strong elemental damage to the part that it hits.

			</p>

			<br/>

			<h4>Basic Flow</h4>

			<p>
				The charge blade can be boiled down to a few simple steps:
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>- Attack in sword mode to build phial energy, then load the energy in your shield.</li>
						<li>- Use the energy in the shield to then charge up the shield, boosting your power.</li>
						<li>- Keep attacking in sword mode to gain more phials.</li>
						<li>- When an opening appears, morph to axe mode and use elemental attacks to deal damage.</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>

				There's much more to the charge blade than what's listed here, but this is just to give a big picture on how the weapon should be used.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<h3>Sword Mode</h3>

			<hr />

			<p>
				The main purpose of sword mode is to build phials, but it has mobility and guard capabilities that the axe is lacking.
				Sword mode is also able to combo into the axe's most powerful attack.
				For these reasons, sword mode will be used for the majority of the time hunting.
				<br/>
				<h4>Basic attacks</h4>
				
				Pressing &#9651; three times does a basic combo: Two quick slashes ending in a spinning slash. <br />
				When you're standing still or running &#9651; +	&#9898;	will perform a forward slash, which is good for closing distance.
				This will substitute the fist hit in a basic combo.
				<br/>
				<h4>Charged Slash</h4>

				Holding 	&#9898;	 will charge up the charged double slash.
				 This move is good at charging phials, and should be used to gain phials quickly.
				 Releasing the button too early or too late will result in a weaker version, the charged slash.
				 Release the button when the sword is positioned behind the your back.

				<br/>
				<h4>Sliding Slash</h4>

				Tilting the left stick and pressing &#9898; after an attack will perform the sliding slash.
				This move slides you a fair distance in the direction you're tilting and ends in a spinning slash.
				This move gives sword mode excellent positioning capabilities, but be careful not to use it accidentally.

				<h4>Shield Thrust</h4>

				Pressing &#9651; + &#9898; after any sword attack will thrust your shield in front of you, hitting twice at close range.
				This move is fast, and is good for chaining two charged double slashes together.
				More importantly this move can combo into the axe mode's amped element discharge, which will be discussed later.
				<br/>
				<h4>Phial Load</h4>

				When enough phial energy is charged, the phial icon in the top left corner will glow.
				Press R2 + 		&#9898;	 to load your phials.
				A yellow glow will result in 3 phials loaded, while a red glow will result in 5.
				If you charge too much energy, your sword attacks will deflect, so make sure you load before that happens.

				From a phial load, you can use the shield thrust, transform into element dicharge I, or use the condensed element slash.

			</p>
			<br />
			<br />

			<h3>Charging your shield</h3>

			<hr />

			<p>
				Before discussing axe mode, we need to understand the benefits to charging the shield, as this should take priority over using phials for axe attacks.<br />
				
				With phials loaded, pressing R2 to cancel the amped element discharge (&#9651; + &#9898; after a shield thrust or in axe mode) will perform the elemental roundslash.
				This attack loads your phials into your shield, charging it and boosting its capabilities.
				The shield charge lasts for 30 seconds per phial, at a maximum of 2 1/2 minutes.

				Shield charging is core to good charge blade as it grants benefits in sword mode and axe mode:
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>- The guard capability of the shield is boosted, and blocking attacks will cause small phial explosions.</li>
						<li>- Small phial explosion added to the shield thrust.</li>
						<li>- Able to power the sword with the condensed element slash</li>
						<li>- Axe mode attack damage is boosted.</li>
						<li>- Phial explosions are more damaging, and impact phials inflict more exhaust and KO status.</li>
						<li>- The amped element discharge upgrades to the super amped element discharge</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<br/>

				<h4>Condensed Element Slash</h4>

				After a phial load, hold &#9651; to charge energy into your sword.
				Release as the shield clamps down to do a condensed element slash.
				Releasing too early or too late will result in the weaker return stroke.

				When the sword is charged, sword attacks will cause small phial explosions.
				In addition, sword attacks will no longer bounce, even if your sword is overcharged.
				However, this effect only lasts for 45 seconds.

				While this move can still be used without a charged shield, all of the special effects are absent, making it practically useless.
			</p>

			<br />
			<br />

			<h3>Axe Mode</h3>

			<hr />

			<p>
				Once the shield is charged, and we've loaded more phials, it's time to morph into axe mode and deal some serious damage.

				<h4>Transformations</h4>

				In sword mode, hold down R2 and press &#9651; to transform into axe mode and end in an overhead slam.
				You can also transform from a phial load into the axe's first elemental attack, at the cost of a phial.
				To transform back into sword mode, just press R2.

				<h4>Normal Axe Attacks</h4>

				Press &#9651; while standing still to do a rising slash. Press &#9651; again do do an overhead slash.
				These two moves can be chained infinitely.
				<br />
				<br />
				Move forward and press &#9651; to do a dash slam.
				This move covers a fair amount of distance, and can be a good opening move.
				You can chain this move after an overhead slash, and go into a rising slash back into an overhead slash.
				<br />
				<br />
				All of these moves are high reaching, and may be useful against pesky flying monsters.
				However, there are bigger and badder attacks we could be using instead.


				<h4>Elemental Attacks</h4>

				Elemental attacks are the charge blade's most powerful moves, which cause phial explosions on impact.
				These attacks come at the cost of your stored phials, and without phials are drastically weaker.
				<br />
				<br />
				Pressing &#9898; will do element discharge I, a quick jab that causes a phial explosion, at the cost of one phial.
				This move is good for getting into axe mode quickly after a phial load.
				<br />
				<br />
				Pressing &#9898; again will do elemet dicharge II, a strong double swing that causes 2 phial explosions for the cost of one.
				You can chain this attack repeatedly with the rising slash, letting you barrage still targets with repeated phial bursts.
				<br />
				<br />
				The amped element dicharge will be the final attack in the combo if your shield isn't charged.
				This attack has a long animation where you "amp up" your axe, ending in an overhead slam that causes 3 phial explosions.
